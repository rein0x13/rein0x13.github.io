                                    usually go with the name <span class="pseudo-redacted" data-str="Wva">...</span> to

                                    while I
                                    occasionally use

                                    I am very interested in
                                    learning more techniques, practices, and technologies (legacy, current, and
                                    emerging) to

                                    Presently, my laptop has 3 different bare-metal operating system installed with
                                    two separate EFI partitions. The
                                    first one is Kubuntu
                                    24.04 LTS (KDE Plasma 5.27 on X11 but have Weston installed for running Wayland-only
                                    applications) and is configured for web development and daily use. I use DDEV to
                                    quickly spin up a docker-based PHP development environments and Visual
                                    Studio Code as my code editor but I'm considering to migrating to a different one.

                                    The second one is Microsoft Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC <span
                                        class="text-neutral-500">(if you know, you know...)</span> for software not
                                    yet (or might never be) natively supported on Linux. Microsoft Office is still
                                    powerful and
                                    polished
                                    compared to LibreOffice, and since one of my hobby is playing the piano, this is
                                    also where my VST libraries live. Both of my external storage are also formatted as
                                    NTFS which
                                    occassionally get some issues that Windows built-in disk utilities easily solves.

                                    The third one is generally where I test out different linux distributions (planning
                                    to learn BSD-based distros in my free time soon too) after installing them in a
                                    virtual machine, experiencing their bare-metal performance.
                                    Currently, Debian 13 (with Gnome 48 desktop environment on
                                    Wayland) is installed just recently, and I've chosen this linux distro particularly
                                    this time to serve as a
                                    fallback for work if things get suddenly broken on my Kubuntu. Previously, this
                                    partition is where my CachyOS lived, a rolling release Arch-based distro to get the
                                    bleeding edge of software and to do some experimentations (thank you BTRFS-snapper
                                    and cachy-chroot
                                    for saving me multiple times). This partition is generally where
                                    I test out different distros (planning to learn FreeBSD soon too in my free time)
                                    after installing them in a virtual machine. Honestly, I wished I explored Linux a
                                    lot earlier.

                                    I'm planning to do some home-labbing in the future and self-host AI locally for
                                    privacy,
                                    control
                                    and simply to learn more. While I love modern and future computers, I'm also fond of
                                    old and retro computers as they hold so much history and are full of character.

                                    I value trust not only in people but also in software. I
                                    have
                                    been using Microsoft Windows in my whole computing life since Windows XP down to
                                    Windows
                                    11. I have previously joined the Windows Insider program to test out new
                                    developments
                                    and
                                    provide feedback before the Fall Creators Update was released back in 2017.
                                    Unfortunately, the more I used Windows, the more I was exposed to its
                                    shady natures. From forced online accounts, system-level advertisements, aggressive
                                    telemetry, automatic non-security breaking updates, it's certainly heart-breaking
                                    what Windows has become.
                                    The
                                    tipping point was when Microsoft pushed an update that corrupted my previous
                                    laptop's
                                    Windows 11 install beyond repair. Lots of
                                    missing and corrupted system files, ACPI and booting issues, and broken windows
                                    recovery, trust in Microsoft fading - that is when I started considering using a
                                    linux-based operating system
                                    instead whenever I can.

                                    Fast forward 4 months after, I bought a second hand Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon
                                    Gen 8
                                    and
                                    has been my daily driver. I have tried multiple linux distributions and desktop
                                    environments each with their own ups and downs... and politics. From the flavors of
                                    Ubuntu Interim and
                                    LTS releases, Debian, Fedora, and CachyOS to the different desktop environments such
                                    as
                                    Gnome, KDE Plasma, XFCE, LXQT, Sway, and Niri WM. Despite choosing a thinkpad, my
                                    experience was not without major setbacks. However, I have loved the experience
                                    overall
                                    and have fallen in love with Free and Open Source Software.

                                    I'm still new to sharing my personal thoughts online, but I hope
                                    that this gives you some unfiltered insights on my character and hoping to reach out
                                    to the right people. I am looking forward
                                    to upskill myself, especially with the
                                    proliferation of AI and
                                    other emerging technologies.

                                    I believe that I have a strong work ethic and sense of responsibility. I acknowledge
                                    that the code I write and the
                                    decisions I make is my responsibility to maintain. As I value clients, the team, and
                                    the
                                    company/organization that I'll be working with, I always put myself ready to fix
                                    bugs whenever they arise at outmost urgency and be willing to maintain their
                                    systems. This is why I also believe that documentation, communication, and
                                    understanding is also important. I do not think only for myself and co-developers, but
                                    I also think for
                                    the
                                    client
                                    and/or
                                    the end users. I would also do in my power to follow relevant laws and protect
                                    confidential data entrusted to me by the client and by the company.

                                    I am always open for feedback and value receiving critism, recognizing these lessons
                                    would help me become a better developer and avoid bad practices and minimize
                                    technical debt.

                                    Aside from using and tinkering with computers, I am also a self-taught pianist. I
                                    love making
                                    music as much as listening. I can usually play by ear depending on the
                                    complexity of the song or piece. My digital piano is always connected through a USB
                                    MIDI interface with a software installed on my laptop known as a Piano VST plugin.
                                    This is where I mostly relax and express myself.

                                    I also love watching various contents on YouTube that are mostly tech-related. I
                                    love
                                    looking at computer benchmarks, product reviews, restoring old laptops and desktop
                                    computers, goofy builds, and more to count. These helped me give the right hardware
                                    recommendations to my friends and/or clients whenever they want to purchase a laptop
                                    or build them their computers. This is also where I gained fondness with Thinkpads
                                    and influenced me on purchasing one.

                                    I used to play games for hours when I was young. The PC game where I used to burn most of

                                    was The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim where I installed a lot of mods, replayed the game a
                                    couple of times, and did lots of tweaks using the built-in game console. I have also
                                    played Cyberpunk 2077 which has helped me on difficult times and has been an eye
                                    opener making me think deeply when it comes to the good and bad about tech,
                                    corporations, and people. After reaching college up to now, I only play seldomly as
